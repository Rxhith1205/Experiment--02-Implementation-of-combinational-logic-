# Experiment--02-Implementation-of-combinational-logic
Implementation of combinational logic gates
 
## AIM:
To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.
 F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D
F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy
 
 
 
## Equipments Required:
## Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher
## Software – Quartus prime


## Theory

Logic gates are electronic circuits which perform logical functions on one or more
inputs to produce one output. Logic gates are electronic circuits which perform
logical functions on one or more inputs to produce one output. F1=
A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy 1.AND gate The
AND gate is an electronic circuit that gives a high output (1) only if all its inputs are
high. A dot (.) is used to show the AND operation i.e. A.B or can be written as AB Y=
A.B 2.OR gate The OR gate is an electronic circuit that gives a high output (1) if one
or more of its inputs are high. A plus (+) is used to show the OR operation. Y= A+B
 

## Procedure
